# vscode-settings
A repository housing the settings and configuration files for our VSCode preferences.

In addition to this README, there are three more files inside this repository. 
* *extensions.json*: this lists out all of our recommended extensions. Upon opening this file in VSCode, you will be prompted to install these extensions. A full list of these extensions are below, in the extensions section.
* *settings.json*: this contains all of our non-default settings.
* *keybindings.json*: this contains our specialty keyboard shortcuts.

But first, we need to set up VSCode with R and LaTeX.

## Instructions for Setting up Your VSCode:

## Installing our Configurations:

Installing our configurations will vary depending on if you have used VSCode before.

If you **have not** used VSCode before, then we recommend the following instructions:
* list here.

If you **have** used VSCode before, this process will be a little more tedious:

### Extensions:
* Azure Repos:
  * Dependency for GitHub extensions.
* Better Comments:
  * Color codes types of comments with symbols at the beginning of each. For example, there are:
    * "*" for highlighting a comment (green)
    * "!" for an alert (red)
    * "?" for a question (blue)
    * "TODO" for a to-do (orange)
    * "//" for a strikethrough
  * You can also customize your own.
* GitHub Copilot
  * In-line suggestions: Copilot will anticipate what you are about to type. You can accept these suggestions, or keep typing.
* GitHub Copilot Chat
  * In-line chat: You can use Cmd+I to start an inline chat, where you can ask Copilot to do something for you. One of my favorites is to ask Copilot "Can you write me the outline of a LaTeX document?"
  * Side chat: You can open up a side-pane for a continuous chat with Copilot, much like Chat-GPT. You can ask Copilot to explain things to you, or to make suggestions.

## Contact Us:
This is a work in progress! If you like to use VSCode for other languages (Python, etc.), let us know which extensions and settings you like -- we'll add them in to our instructions. If you have additional extensions, settings, or keybindings you'd like to share, please do so!

You can contact me at dominic_skinnion@iq.harvard.edu. Thanks!
