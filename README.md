# Setting Up Visual Studio Code (The IQSS Way)

With its Copilot integration and a marketplace full of extensions, we recommend using **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** for your coding IDE. It is especially useful if you are in academia, and need to write in R[^1], Python, LaTeX, etc. 

Here' we'll teach you how to download VSCode, as well as the extensions, settings, and shortcuts that we like to make this a more robust text editor. Of course, you may not have the same preferences! Once you have these downloaded, you can customize your VSCode with the extensions, settings, and shortcuts that you like. We'd love to hear feedback from you and incorporate your suggestions into our recommended profile![^2]

## 1. Instructions for Downloading VSCode:
Visual Studio Code has [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics) for getting started.

You can download VSCode directly from their [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your operating system.

Unzip the download (mine was called "VSCode-darwin-universal.zip), and then click on the new application (Visual Studio Code). A pop-up will ask you if you want to open an app downloaded from the internet. Click open.

Congrats, you've downloaded VSCode!

## 2. Importing Our Recommended Profile
* Inside VSCode, click on the settings icon in the bottom-left corner
* Select "Profiles (*Name of your current profile*)" &#8592; this should be "Profiles (Default)" if you are doing this for the first time
* Select "Import Profile"
* Copy and paste the following URL into the search bar pop-up that says "Provide Profile Template URL": https://vscode.dev/profile/github/436e1bef975d60cc8d55a5dc7a866100
* A pane on the left will pop up. Leave everything checked off, and select the blue "Create Profile" button
* Enter a name for this profile in the text pop-up, such as "IQSS Recs"
* Leave everything checked off, and select the blue "Create" button

Now the settings icon should have a short descriptor bubble attached, e.g. "IQ", and if you click on it, you should see that it now says "Profiles (*Profile Name*)", such as "Profiles (IQSS Rec)"

Congrats, you've imported our recommended profile!

This includes:
* **extensions**, which will automatically install for you. You can access these by clicking the extensions icon on the left-hand toolbar, which has three squares in an L shape with an additional square that is separated at the top right corner.
* **settings.json**, which you can access by clicking the settings icon, selecting Settings, and then clicking the "Open Setting (JSON)" icon in the file toolbar, which looks like a piece of paper with a curved arrow.
* **keybindings.json**, which you can access by clicking the settings icon, selecting Keyboard Shortcuts, and then clicking the "Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)" icon in the file toolbar, which looks like a piece of paper with a curved arrow.

### Extensions:
* **Azure Repos**:
  * Dependency for GitHub extensions.
* **Better Comments**:
  * Color codes types of comments with symbols at the beginning of each. For example, there are:
    * "*" for highlighting a comment (green)
    * "!" for an alert (red)

    * "TODO" for a to-do (orange)
    * "//" for a strikethrough

  * Side chat: You can open up a side-pane for a continuous chat with Copilot, much like Chat-GPT. You can ask Copilot to explain things to you, or to make suggestions.

### Settings
We've added a few non-default settings, which will be automatically configured with this profile. Again, you might not like all of these â€” feel free to remove these from your settings.json file.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
We've also added a few keyboard shortcuts. You can remove these from your keybindings.json file if you do not like them. You can also add your own keyboard shortcuts by clicking the settings icon, selecting Keyboard Shortcuts and then searching for the command which you'd like to add.


## Contact Us:
This is a work in progress! If you like to use VSCode for other languages (Python, etc.), let us know which extensions and settings you like! If you have additional extensions, settings, or keybindings you'd like to share, please do so!

[^1]: My personal opinion: RStudio also has Copilot integration now, so that is still a great alternative if you are just writing .R or .Rmd files. Some may even prefer it! I suggest taking a look at Matt Blackwell's instructions for [Getting Started with R, R Studio, Git, and GitHub](https://gov51.mattblackwell.org/assignments/00-r-intro/), as well as Posit's [R Studio User Guide for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/copilot.html).
