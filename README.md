# vscode-settings
A repository housing the settings and configuration files for our VSCode preferences.

In addition to this README, there are three more files inside this repository. 
* *extensions.json*: this lists out all of our recommended extensions. Upon opening this file in VSCode, you will be prompted to install these extensions. A full list of these extensions are below, in the extensions section.
* *settings.json*: this contains all of our non-default settings.
* *keybindings.json*: this contains our specialty keyboard shortcuts.

*If you've already installed VSCode, skip the following section.*

### Extensions:

  * Color codes types of comments with symbols at the beginning of each. For example, there are:
    * "*" for highlighting a comment (green)
