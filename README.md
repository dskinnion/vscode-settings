# vscode-settings
A repository housing the settings and configuration files for our VSCode preferences.

In addition to this README, there are three more files inside this repository. 
* *extensions.json*: this lists out all of our recommended extensions. Upon opening this file in VSCode, you will be prompted to install these extensions.
* *settings.json*: this contains all of our non-default settings.
* *keybindings.json*: this contains our specialty keyboard shortcuts.

But first, we need to set up VSCode with R and LaTeX.

## Contact Us:
This is a work in progress! If you like to use VSCode for other languages (Python, etc.), let us know which extensions and settings you like -- we'll add them in to our instructions. If you have additional extensions, settings, or keybindings you'd like to share, please do so!

You can contact me at dominic_skinnion@iq.harvard.edu. Thanks!
